## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name
cd project-name

# Option 1: Use setup script (installs UV if needed)
./setup.sh

# Option 2: Manual setup with UV
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate environment (Linux/Mac)
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Activate environment (Windows)

# Run analysis
uv run python src/main.py

# Start Jupyter notebook (traditional)
uv run jupyter notebook

# Start Marimo notebook (reactive, modern)
uv run marimo edit

# Or use Make commands
make install    # Install dependencies
make notebook   # Start Jupyter
make marimo     # Start Marimo
make test       # Run tests
```

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Package Manager: UV (fast Python package manager)
* Data Processing: Pandas, Polars (fast DataFrame operations)
* Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* Notebooks: Jupyter (traditional), Marimo (reactive)
* Environment: Python 3.10+

## 💻 Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Install with dev dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run scripts with UV
uv run python src/main.py

# Start Jupyter (traditional notebook)
uv run jupyter notebook

# Start Marimo (reactive notebook - automatically re-runs cells!)
uv run marimo edit

# Create new Marimo notebook
uv run marimo new notebooks/analysis.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/

# Check code quality
uv run ruff check src/
```

## 🌟 Why Polars?

Polars is included alongside Pandas for:

* ⚡ 10x faster operations on large datasets
* 🔄 Lazy evaluation - optimizes query plans automatically
* 💾 Better memory usage - handles datasets larger than RAM
* 🎯 Similar API to Pandas - easy to learn

## 🎨 Why Marimo?

Marimo is included alongside Jupyter for:

* 🔄 Reactive execution - cells auto-update when dependencies change
* 🐛 No hidden state - prevents common notebook bugs
* 🚀 Runs as scripts - notebooks are just Python files
* 🎯 Git-friendly - clean diffs, easy versioning
* 📱 Interactive apps - deploy notebooks as web apps

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Update this README with your project details
2. Add your data to the data/raw folder
3. Create notebooks for exploration (Jupyter or Marimo)
4. Build your analysis pipeline
5. Try Polars for large dataset operations
